# Installing pyliqtr

This is a guide for installing `pyliqtr` on your machine.
It also lists all the various other applications you may need to install from scratch and get yourself running.

## Environments

Most people use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for virutal environment management, which is the currently supported configuration for using and developing `pyliqtr`.

## `pyliqtr` installation steps

1. [Create a new environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
    for pyliqtr, and activate it:

    ```sh
    on Windows use:
    conda create -n <Environment Name> "python>=3.8,<=3.11.5" pip
    on Mac use:
    conda create -n <Environment Name> python'>=3.8,<=3.11.5' pip
    conda activate <Environment Name>
    ```

    It is important that you install `pip` within this environment, so that later steps that call `pip` will install `pyliqtr` to your new environment and not to the base environment.

    *N.B.* the quotes around the `python` version specification will override the
    pipe functionality of >.

2. Navigate one directory above where you want to clone the repository and clone:

    ```sh
    cd one_dir_above_repo/
    git clone https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/pyLIQTR.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the git repo, and install the package!
    This installs all requirements into the current environment, so it can take a while the first time you install.

    Note that the `-e` flag below installs in `pyliqtr` 'editable' mode.
    This means that as you switch branches, commit changes, or pull from remote, your local version of `pyliqtr` will update with those changes without you needing to reinstall it.

    If you would rather work with a **stable version and not change it**, you could drop the `-e .` and install directly from a stable release or git tag.
    Please don't hesitate to ask for assistance in that scenario!

    **Basic requirements installation:**

    ```sh
    cd repo
    pip install .
    ```

    **Development requirements installation (*only needed if you are going to be doing coding work*):**

    ```sh
    cd repo
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

    *N.B.* if using `zsh` instead of `bash` (e.g on a new Mac), the dependencies must be installed via a slightly modified command:

    ```sh
    pip install -e .'[dev]'
    ```

    Optional requirements can be combined with a comma-separated list like 

    ```sh
    pip install -e .[pygpen,dev]
    ```

4. Quick verification that installation was successful: the following command should execute silently.

    ```sh
    python -c "import pyliqtr"
    ```
